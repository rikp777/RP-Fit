# Project Documentation: In-Depth Muscle Response Visualization

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide users with an in-depth understanding of how their muscles respond to workouts and exercises. The application aims to offer a comprehensive view of muscle activity, recovery, and growth, thereby enabling users to make informed decisions about their fitness routines.

### Ultimate Goal

The ultimate aspiration of this project is to create a visual representation that dynamically illustrates muscle recovery. Muscles that have been recently exercised will be highlighted in red, indicating that they are in the recovery phase. Over time, the color will gradually transition back to green, signaling that the muscles are recovered and it is advisable to train them again.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Muscle Metrics**: Capture real-time metrics related to muscle performance, including fatigue levels, activation levels, and temperature.
2. **User Muscle Profile**: Maintain a profile for each user that includes specific muscle strengths, weaknesses, and preferences.
3. **Exercise-Muscle Mapping**: Provide a detailed mapping of exercises to the muscles they target, along with the intensity of the targeting.
4. **Muscle Injury Tracking**: Keep track of any muscle injuries and their recovery status.
5. **Dynamic Visualization**: Implement a dynamic visual representation of muscle groups, color-coded based on their current recovery status.

## Technical Overview

* **Backend**: Spring Boot with Java, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
* **Database**: JPA with Hibernate for data persistence.
* **Frontend**: (To be decided, e.g., React, Angular, etc.)
* **Data Collection**: Integration with wearable devices for real-time data (optional).

## Packages

* `user`: Manages user data and roles.
* `exercise`: Handles exercise-related entities and logic.
* `muscle`: Manages muscle-related entities, including metrics and injuries.
* `workout`: Manages workout plans, sessions, and histories.
* `equipment`: Handles information related to workout equipment.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Models**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict muscle recovery times based on historical data.
2. **Integration with Health Apps**: Integrate with third-party health and fitness apps to pull in additional metrics.
3. **Community Features**: Add social features like sharing workout plans, following users, etc.

## Conclusion

By providing users with a detailed and dynamic view of their muscle activity and recovery, this project aims to revolutionize the way people approach their fitness routines. The ultimate goal is to offer a scientifically-backed, data-driven platform that makes fitness more personalized, effective, and safe.
